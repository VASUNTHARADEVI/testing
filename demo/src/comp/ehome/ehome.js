The carts build on Amazons “Just Walk Out” cashierless technology first deployed in Amazon Go convenience stores. They use a combination of computer vision and sensors to identify items as theyre placed in bags inside the cart. As shoppers add and remove items, a display on the cart adjusts the total price. Shoppers exit the store through a special lane, and Amazon automatically charges their credit card.</p>
